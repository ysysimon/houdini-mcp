# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Role & Philosophy

**Role:** Senior Software Developer

**Core Tenets:** DRY, SOLID, YAGNI, KISS

**Communication Style:**
- Concise and minimal. Focus on code, not chatter
- Provide clear rationale for architectural decisions
- Surface tradeoffs when multiple approaches exist

**Planning Protocol:**
- For complex requests: Provide bulleted outline/plan before writing code
- For simple requests: Execute directly
- Override keyword: **"skip planning"** — Execute immediately without planning phase
- Do not give time estimates unless explicitly asked

## Project Overview

HoudiniMCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) bridge connecting SideFX Houdini to Claude AI. It provides 41+ MCP tools for programmatic Houdini control — node operations, rendering, geometry, PDG/TOPs, USD/Solaris, HDA management, scene management, offline docs search, and a bidirectional event system.

## Best Practices

See **[BEST_PRACTICES.md](BEST_PRACTICES.md)** for hard-won lessons from production use — Copernicus COP pitfalls, ImageLayer creation, temporal effects, diagnostics workflow, and more. Organized by context (COPs, SOPs, etc.) so you can jump to what's relevant.

## Running

```bash
# Run the MCP bridge server (communicates with Claude over stdio, with Houdini over TCP)
uv run python houdini_mcp_server.py

# Install dependencies
uv add "mcp[cli]"

# Run tests (no Houdini instance required)
pytest tests/ -v

# Fetch Houdini docs for offline search
python scripts/fetch_houdini_docs.py

# Install plugin into Houdini
python scripts/install.py
```

## Architecture

```
Claude (MCP stdio) → houdini_mcp_server.py (Bridge) → TCP:9876 → server.py (Plugin) → hou API
                   ↘ houdini_rag.py (docs search, local-only)
```

### Layer 1: Houdini Plugin (`src/houdinimcp/`)
- Runs **inside** the Houdini process. Uses the `hou` module (Houdini Python API).
- `HoudiniMCPServer` in `server.py` listens on `localhost:9876` with a non-blocking TCP socket polled via Qt's `QTimer`.
- `execute_command()` dispatches JSON commands to handler functions in `handlers/`.
- Mutating commands are wrapped in `hou.undos.group()` for undo support.
- `EventCollector` registers Houdini callbacks (hipFile, node, playbar) and buffers events with deduplication.
- `claude_terminal.py` provides a dockable PySide2 panel with tabbed Claude CLI sessions.

### Layer 2: MCP Bridge (`houdini_mcp_server.py`)
- Runs in a **separate** Python process (via `uv run`).
- `HoudiniConnection` dataclass manages a persistent TCP connection (global singleton).
- `_send_tool_command()` helper reduces each MCP tool to ~3 lines.
- `search_docs` and `get_doc` tools run locally via `houdini_rag.py` — no Houdini connection needed.

### Layer 3: Rendering (`src/houdinimcp/HoudiniMCPRender.py`)
- Utility module imported by `handlers/rendering.py` (runs inside Houdini).
- Handles camera rig setup, geometry bounding box calculation, and rendering.
- Rendered images are base64-encoded for JSON transport.

## Key Patterns

- **Handler modules**: Standalone functions in `handlers/*.py` that import `hou` directly. Dispatched via dict in `server.py:_get_handlers()`.
- **`_send_tool_command()` helper**: All MCP tool wrappers in the bridge use this to send commands and handle errors uniformly.
- **Global connection singleton**: `houdini_mcp_server.py` reuses one TCP connection across all MCP tool calls.
- **Dangerous code guard**: `handlers/code.py` blocks `os.remove`, `subprocess`, `hou.exit`, etc. unless `allow_dangerous=True`.
- **Event deduplication**: `EventCollector` collapses rapid-fire events (same type + path within 100ms) into one.
- **BM25 docs search**: `houdini_rag.py` is pure stdlib — no external deps. Index lazy-loaded on first search.

## Dependencies

- **Python:** 3.12+ (see `.python-version`)
- **Package manager:** `uv` (or pip)
- Declared in `pyproject.toml`: `mcp[cli]>=1.4.1`
- Houdini-side code depends on `hou`, `PySide2`, and standard library modules
- `houdini_rag.py` has zero external dependencies (stdlib only)

## Testing

69 tests across 5 test files:
- `test_bridge_connection.py` — HoudiniConnection (AST extraction, mock TCP server)
- `test_server_commands.py` — command dispatcher, handlers, MUTATING_COMMANDS, events
- `test_houdini_rag.py` — tokenizer, BM25 index, search, document loading
- `test_event_collector.py` — EventCollector with mocked hou callbacks
- `test_terminal.py` — ANSI stripping, terminal constants

All tests run without Houdini. `server.py` tests mock `hou`, `PySide2`, `numpy`. `houdini_mcp_server.py` tests use AST extraction to avoid FastMCP side effects.

## Behavioral Guidelines

Guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Biased toward caution over speed—use judgment for trivial tasks.

### Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them—don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked
- No abstractions for single-use code
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested
- No defensive code for scenarios the caller cannot produce
- If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite it

### Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it—don't delete it
- Remove only imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes orphaned

### No Unrequested Fallbacks

**Do one thing. If it fails, report—don't silently try alternatives.**

Violations:
- `try: primary() except: fallback()` — just call `primary()`
- "If the file doesn't exist, create it" — if it should exist, raise
- Retry loops for operations that aren't network calls
- Multiple implementation strategies "for robustness"

Unrequested fallbacks hide bugs, complicate debugging, and add untested code paths.

**The rule:** One path. Let it fail loudly.

### Goal-Driven Execution

**State success criteria before implementing. Verify after.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Tests for invalid inputs pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Regression test passes"
- "Refactor X" → "Tests pass before and after"

## Enforcement Checklist

Before proposing code changes, pass these checks.

### Scope Check
- [ ] List files to modify: `[file1, file2, ...]`
- [ ] Each file traces to user request or direct dependency
- [ ] No "while I'm here" improvements

### Complexity Check
- [ ] No new classes/modules unless requested
- [ ] No new abstractions for single use
- [ ] No configuration options unless requested
- [ ] No fallback/retry logic unless requested

### Diff Audit
- [ ] Diff under 100 lines (excluding tests), or justification provided
- [ ] No whitespace-only changes outside modified blocks
- [ ] No comment changes unless behavior changed
- [ ] Removed code: only YOUR orphans

### Verification Gate
- [ ] Success criteria stated before implementation
- [ ] Verification method identified (test, type check, manual)
- [ ] Verification ran and passed

## Contributing to Best Practices

When you discover a **non-trivial** Houdini behavior while working through this MCP — silent failures, undocumented API quirks, metadata requirements, required parameter ordering, etc. — add it to [`BEST_PRACTICES.md`](BEST_PRACTICES.md).

**What qualifies as non-trivial:**
- Behavior that has no error message (silent failure)
- API usage where parameter order or metadata matters but isn't documented
- Workarounds for missing Houdini features (e.g., no timeshift in Copernicus)
- Anything that took multiple attempts to diagnose

**How to add it:**
1. **Read `BEST_PRACTICES.md` first** — check that the item isn't already covered
2. Place it under the appropriate context section (COPs, SOPs, LOPs, TOPs, etc.)
3. Create the section if it doesn't exist yet
4. Add an entry to the Index at the top of the file
5. **Include the Houdini version** (e.g., `> Houdini 21.0.631`) — behaviors change between releases
6. **Use anti-pattern format** when applicable: "Tried X, it silently failed, do Y instead"
7. Be brief: problem, symptom, fix. A few sentences, not paragraphs. Code snippets only when the syntax is the non-obvious part

Do **not** add trivial items (standard API usage, well-documented behavior, one-off bugs).

## Code Style

- **Naming:** `snake_case` functions/variables, `PascalCase` classes. Self-documenting names.
- **Comments:** Only for complex algorithms, performance workarounds, TODO/FIXME. No commented-out code. Explain **why**, not **what**.
- **Imports:** Standard library → Third-party → Local
- **Statelessness:** Pass dependencies explicitly. Acceptable state: caching, connection pooling, configuration.

---

## Error Handling

- Don't catch errors you can't handle
- Fail fast for programmer errors (assertions)
- Handle gracefully for user errors (validation)
- Validate at system boundaries only (CLI args, file inputs). Trust internal functions.

---

## Git Conventions

**Commits:** Atomic, working code, clear messages.

**Message Format:**
```
type(scope): short description

Longer explanation if needed. Explain WHY, not what.
```
**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`

---

## Critical Rules (Summary)

1. **One path, no fallbacks.** Don't `try X except: Y`. Let it fail.
2. **Touch only what's asked.** No adjacent "improvements."
3. **No single-use abstractions.** No helpers for one call site.
4. **Verify before done.** Run it. Test it. Don't guess.
5. **Uncertain? Ask.** Don't pick silently between interpretations.
